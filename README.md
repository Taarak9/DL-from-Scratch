# Neural-Networks

**Activation functions and Loss functions**
 * Activation functions and its derivatives
     * Identity, Sigmoid, Softmax, Tanh, ReLU
 * Loss functions
     * Mean Squared Error, Cross Entropy    

**Feedforward Neural Network**   
* Backpropagation ( Computes the gradient of Loss function ) Learning using mini-batch stochastic Gradient Descent  
    * In each epoch, it starts by randomly shuffling the training data, and then partitions it into mini-batches. 
    * Then for each mini_batch we apply a single step of gradient descent, which updates the network weights and biases.    

**Linear Classifier**          
Aeroplane Classification using Linear Classifier with two variants
* Perceptron learning rule; mode = online learning, loss fn =  MSE
* Gradient descent; mode = batch learning, loss fn = Cross Entropy

**Hopfield Neural Network**
